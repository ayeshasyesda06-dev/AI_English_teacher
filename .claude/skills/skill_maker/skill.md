# Skill Maker

## Overview

The Skill Maker is a specialized meta-skill designed to facilitate the generation and construction of custom skills within the Claude Code ecosystem. It automates the skill creation process by adhering strictly to Claude Code's official documentation and architectural standards.

## Purpose and Scope

This skill provides automated skill generation capabilities, eliminating manual implementation complexities and ensuring compliance with established Claude Code protocols and specifications.

## Functional Specifications

### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Documentation Retrieval**: Access and parse Claude Code official documentation regarding skill architecture and design patterns
2. **Requirement Elicitation**: Conduct comprehensive questioning to understand desired skill specifications and objectives
3. **Specification Generation**: Create formal skill specifications aligned with Claude Code standards
4. **Skill Scaffolding**: Generate complete skill file structures with appropriate boilerplate code
5. **Validation**: Ensure generated skills conform to official documentation requirements
6. **Documentation Generation**: Produce comprehensive skill documentation

### Input Requirements

- **Skill Name**: The identifier and designation for the skill to be created
- **Skill Description**: High-level articulation of skill purpose and functionality
- **User Clarifications**: Responses to follow-up questions regarding implementation details

### Output Deliverables

- Complete skill file structure
- Fully documented skill files adhering to Claude Code standards
- Configuration files as required by architecture specifications
- Implementation templates following best practices

## Cross-Checking and Validation Protocol

The Skill Maker shall:

1. **Conduct Clarification Interviews**: Pose systematic questions to disambiguate requirements
2. **Validate Against Documentation**: Cross-reference all specifications with official Claude Code documentation
3. **Identify Constraints**: Determine architectural limitations and compatibility requirements
4. **Confirm Specifications**: Obtain user acknowledgment of generated specifications before implementation
5. **Document Assumptions**: Record all assumptions made during the skill generation process

## Operational Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

The skill shall systematically interrogate the user regarding:

- Desired skill name and purpose
- Input parameters and expected outputs
- Dependencies and integration requirements
- Performance characteristics and constraints
- Documentation and testing requirements

### Phase 2: Specification Development

Development of formal specifications based on:

- Official Claude Code documentation standards
- User-provided requirements
- Architectural best practices
- Security and compliance considerations

### Phase 3: Implementation

Automated generation of:

- Directory structure and file organization
- Skill configuration files
- Core implementation templates
- Documentation artifacts
- Test framework scaffolding

### Phase 4: Validation and Delivery

Comprehensive validation ensuring:

- Compliance with all official documentation standards
- Correctness of file structures and configurations
- Completeness of documentation
- Readiness for deployment and testing

## Integration with Claude Code

The Skill Maker skill is designed to seamlessly integrate with Claude Code's official skill management systems and strictly adheres to all documented protocols, standards, and best practices.
