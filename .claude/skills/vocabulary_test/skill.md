1. **Test Administration**: Deliver structured examination across three sections
2. **Response Evaluation**: Assess correctness of user answers
3. **Performance Calculation**: Compute percentile and sectional scores
4. **Result Reporting**: Provide structured performance report
5. **Scoring Accuracy**: Maintain objective, consistent evaluation standards

### Examination Sections

**Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions (10 questions)**
- Assess word meaning comprehension
- Evaluate contextual vocabulary usage
- Test recognition and discrimination abilities

**Section 2: Fill in the Blanks (10 questions)**

- User responses to all 25 test questions
- Sequential completion of all three examination sections

## Output Deliverables

- Section-specific correctness scores
- Item-by-item correctness indicators
- Cumulative percentage score
- Structured results report

## Operational Parameters

### Constraints and Boundaries

- Do NOT provide explanations for incorrect answers
- Do NOT offer corrective feedback or remediation
- Do NOT teach vocabulary meanings
- Report only correctness and score metrics
- Maintain strict objectivity in evaluation

### Evaluation Criteria

**MCQ Evaluation:**

- Word is used appropriately in context
- Sentence is grammatically acceptable
- Meaning of word is clearly conveyed

## Assessment Methodology

### Validity and Reliability

- Questions target 25 specified vocabulary words
- Evaluation criteria applied consistently
- Scoring methodology transparent and replicable
- All questions appropriately difficulty-calibrated

### Non-Intervention Policy

Assessment maintains pure evaluation function:

- No corrective guidance provided
- No example sentences offered
- No meaning clarifications supplied
- Results reported factually without interpretation

## Integration Requirements

This skill functions as the primary assessment tool for vocabulary knowledge verification, operationalizing vocabulary generated through the Vocabulary Generator skill.
